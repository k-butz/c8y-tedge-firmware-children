# About

This is a repository to show different options on how thin-edge.io can be used to update the Firmware of a connected child-device. The documentation assumes a Gateway having thin-edge.io running (but does not assume to have it running on Devices connected to this Gateway). 

Please have a look into the markdown files in the projects root to see your options.
